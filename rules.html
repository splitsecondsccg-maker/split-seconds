    <h2>Split Seconds - Official Rulebook</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>The Premise</h3>
    <p><strong>Split Seconds</strong> is a high-speed, double-blind dueling game where combat happens in flashes of precognition. You and your opponent will secretly plan a sequence of strikes, defenses, and abilities across a <strong>5-Moment Timeline</strong>. Before the clash begins, you will both get a glimpse of the future. Will you stick to your plan, or will you pay the price to panic, pivot, and outsmart your enemy?</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">The Objective:</span> Reduce your opponent's Health Points (HP) to 0 before they do the same to you!</p>

    <h3>1. Core Resources & Classes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong style="color: #2ecc71;">Health (HP):</strong> Your life force. If it hits 0, you lose.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #f1c40f;">Stamina (⚡):</strong> The energy used to play cards. Powerful attacks and parries cost Stamina.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #3498db;">The Timeline:</strong> A board with <strong>5 Slots (Moments)</strong>. Every turn, you arrange your moves into these 5 moments. Fast actions take 1 moment; heavy attacks take 2 or 3 moments to "charge up" and trigger on their final slot.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #9b59b6;">Class Passives:</strong> Every class (Brute, Rogue, Paladin, etc.) has a unique <strong>Passive Ability</strong> that is permanently active during the match. Check your class details to see your unique advantage!</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #e67e22;">Hand Limit:</strong> You can only hold a maximum of <strong>7 cards</strong> in your hand at once. Managing your hand size through planning and Exertion is key to making sure you have room to draw new cards!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. The Combat System & Actions</h3>
    <p>Combat is built around predicting your opponent's exact sequence. The core triangle is simple: <strong>Attacks beat Grabs, Grabs beat Defenses, and Defenses beat Attacks.</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attacks ⚔️ :</strong> Deal damage to the opponent's HP. They will hit unless Blocked or Parried. Attacks will also completely interrupt and defeat an opponent who is trying to Grab you.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocks 🛡️ <span class="cost-note">(Cost: 0 ⚡ | Limit: Unlimited)</span>:</strong> Reduces incoming damage. Since they cost nothing, you can fill as many empty slots with Blocks as you want to survive a turn when you are low on Stamina.</li>
        <li><strong>Parries 🤺 <span class="cost-note">(Cost: 1 ⚡ | Limit: Unlimited)</span>:</strong> Completely negates an incoming Attack. <span class="highlight">If you successfully Parry an Attack, the attacker is staggered and will draw 1 less card at the start of the next round.</span> You can play multiple Parries per turn, provided you have the Stamina.</li>
        <li><strong>Grabs 🤚 <span class="cost-note">(Limit: Based on cards)</span>:</strong> Grappling moves designed specifically to punish defensive players. <strong>Grabs completely bypass Blocks and Parries.</strong> However, Grabs <em>only</em> resolve if the opponent is actively Blocking or Parrying in that moment! If the opponent is Attacking, or if their slot is simply empty, your Grab completely misses.</li>
        <li><strong>Empty Slots 🕳️ <span class="cost-note">(Cost: 0 ⚡ | Limit: Unlimited)</span>:</strong> You do not <em>have</em> to fill every moment! Leaving a slot completely blank costs no Stamina. While this leaves you defenseless against Attacks, <strong>it is a brilliant way to make an opponent's Grab completely miss</strong> if you anticipate one and don't have the Stamina to Attack!</li>
        <li><strong>Class Abilities 🌟 <span class="cost-note">(Limit: Once per turn)</span>:</strong> Unique active skills based on your chosen class. You may only place each specific ability onto the timeline <strong>once per round</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>⚔️ Combat Examples:</h4>
        <p><strong>Example 1 (The Parry):</strong> You place a 3-moment Heavy Attack (Moments 1, 2, 3). Your opponent places a Parry in Moment 3. Your attack triggers on Moment 3, hits the Parry, and is negated. You take no damage, but you will draw 1 less card next turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2 (The Grab):</strong> You place a Grab in Moment 2. Your opponent placed a Block in Moment 2. Because they are in a defensive stance, your Grab connects, bypassing their Block and dealing its full effect!</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3 (The Empty Dodge):</strong> You place a Grab in Moment 2. Your opponent anticipated this, so they left Moment 2 <strong>Empty</strong>. Because they are not Blocking or Parrying, your Grab fails completely!</p>
    </div>



    <h3>2.5 Statuses & Keywords</h3>
    <p>Some cards apply lasting effects called <strong>Statuses</strong>. These are tracked as badges under each fighter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FREEZE ❄️ :</strong> A <strong>stackable debuff</strong> that is <strong>not removed at end of turn</strong>. When a fighter reaches <strong>10+ FREEZE</strong>, all of their <strong>Attacks</strong> cost <strong>+1 Stamina</strong> until their FREEZE is reduced (for example by effects like <em>Break the Ice</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Turn Phases</h3>
    <p>Every round follows a strict sequence of events:</p>

    <h4>Phase 1: Upkeep & Exertion</h4>
    <p>Before you plan your moves, you prepare your resources for the round:</p>
    <ol>
        <p>At the very start of the match, both players begin with a starting hand of <strong>3 cards</strong>. Each subsequent round follows this flow:</p>
        <li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> Both players automatically regenerate <strong>3 Stamina</strong> (up to their character's maximum).</li>
        <li><strong>Exertion (Optional):</strong> You may permanently discard cards from your hand to gain <strong>+1 Stamina</strong> per card discarded. This happens before you draw!</li>
        <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Both players draw up to <strong>2 new cards</strong> to replenish their hands. 
            <ul>
                <li><em>The Hand Limit:</em> If drawing would put you over your maximum hand size of <strong>7</strong>, you stop drawing and the excess cards are discarded to the void.</li>
                <li><em>The Parry Penalty:</em> If your attack was Parried in the previous round, your draw is reduced by 1!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Phase 2: Planning (Double-Blind)</h4>
    <p>Both players secretly drag and drop cards onto their 5-Moment Timeline. You must pay the Stamina cost of the cards upfront. Once you are happy with your sequence, you Lock In.</p>

    <h4>Phase 3: The Precognition Flash</h4>
    <p>The engine randomly selects <strong>one of the 5 moments</strong> and reveals what both players have placed in that exact slot. You now have a glimpse of the future.</p>

    <h4>Phase 4: The Pivot</h4>
    <p>Did the Flash reveal that your heavy attack is about to get Parried? It's time to Pivot!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Both players evaluate the revealed cards simultaneously.</li>
        <li>You may choose to pay a <strong>1 Stamina Tax</strong> to cancel the exact card you revealed in the Flash. <em>(You must have at least 1 Stamina saved up to do this!)</em></li>
        <li>The canceled card is returned to your hand, and its initial Stamina cost is refunded to you.</li>
        <li>You now enter a "Mini-Planning" phase where you can secretly drop new cards into those freed-up slots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Phase 5: The Clash (Resolution)</h4>
    <p>The Timeline unlocks and the engine resolves the combat moment by moment, from Moment 1 to Moment 5. Cards placed in the same moment clash against each other based on the Combat System rules above. Once Moment 5 resolves, the round ends and a new Turn begins at Phase 1!</p>

    <div class="example-box" style="border-left-color: #f1c40f;">
        <h4 style="color: #f1c40f;">💡 Advanced Tactical Tips</h4>
        <p><strong>Save 1 Stamina for the Pivot:</strong> If you end your Planning Phase with 0 Stamina, <strong>you cannot afford to Pivot</strong>. If the Flash reveals you are walking into a trap, you will be forced to just watch it happen!</p>
        <p><strong>Bait the Pivot:</strong> If the Flash reveals your opponent is Blocking, and you are Attacking, they might Pivot to try and Grab you. You can anticipate this by Pivoting your <em>own</em> Attack into a fast 1-moment Attack to counter their incoming Grab!</p>
